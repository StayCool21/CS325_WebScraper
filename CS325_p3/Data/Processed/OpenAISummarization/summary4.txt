Title: Gimmicks or not, some have ideas for a Thermal Club redux | RACER
IndyCar and The Thermal Club may consider changes for a potential $1 Million Challenge all-star race.
Suggestions include single-car qualifying, a joker lap, and push-to-pass without response.
Participants propose improvements like more overtaking opportunities, avoiding tire degradation, and involving all cars in the main race for increased excitement and strategy.
